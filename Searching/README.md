# Searching Algorithms

Implementation of DFS,BFS,UCS and A* Algorithms in Python.

## Features
- Implements Depth-first search (DFS), Breadth-first search (BFS), 
  Uniform-cost search (UCS) and A* algorithms for pathfinding in a graph
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running the algorithm
- Can handle graphs with different types of edges (weighted/unweighted)
- Can handle graphs with different types of heuristics (manhattan, euclidean, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of costs (steps, time, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of nodes (2D, 3D, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of representation (adjacency list, matrix, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of search space (discrete, continuous, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of goals (single goal, multiple goals, etc)
- Can handle graphs with different types of starting points (single starting point, multiple starting points, etc)
