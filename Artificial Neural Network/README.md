# MLP Classification adn the Backpropagation Algorithm

Implementation of the Backpropagation Algorithm in Python.

## Features
- Implements the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks
- Provides multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc)
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running the algorithm
- Can handle datasets with different types of inputs (numerical, categorical, image, etc)
- Can handle datasets with different types of outputs (binary, multiclass, etc)
- Can handle datasets with different types of preprocessing (normalization, scaling, etc)
- Can handle different types of architectures (Fully Connected, Convolutional, etc)
- Can handle different types of activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, etc)
- Can handle different types of loss functions (Mean Squared Error, Cross Entropy, etc)
- Can handle different types of optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc)
- Can handle different types of regularization techniques (L1, L2, Dropout, etc)
