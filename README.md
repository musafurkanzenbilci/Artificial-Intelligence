# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects related to artificial intelligence, including implementation of different protocols, algorithms and technologies.

## Projects

1. **Searching Algorithms**: A simple implementation of DFS,BFS,UCS and A* in Python.
2. **Adverserial Search**: An implementation of minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms for the Game of Nim in Python.
3. **Bayes Net**: An implementation of BayesNet with Enumerational Inference and Gibbs Sampling in Python.
4. **Propagation Algorithm**: An implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks with classification in Python.
## Getting Started

To run the projects, you need to have the following tools and libraries installed on your computer:

- Python 3 (if you want to run the Python projects)
- Any other dependencies or libraries that are specific to a project (these will be listed in the project's readme)

To run a project, simply navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the project's readme.
